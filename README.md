# Abstract

Since the year 2000, the number of movies released in the UK as well as the US more than doubled. While the industry is rapidly growing, a significant proportion of movies continue to fall short of achieving significant recognition or commercial success. This proves that making a successful movie is a far more intricate process than it appears. While this seems to be a daunting task, separating it into smaller and simpler parts will put things into perspective. The CMU dataset contains data on more than 80’000 movies and with that, we will try to depict a cheat sheet for a perfect movie.

# Research Questions

In this project, we are trying to find what features affect a movie's rating, and to do so we have decided to focus on the following questions:

•	How the language of a movie impact its success? What about the use of English compared to other languages?

•	Does the apparition of a character name more than once affect how much a viewer will get attached to a movie and thus rate it higher?

•	Does release date have an influence? If yes, when is it best to release a movie? Does it have a link with the genre ?

•	What makes a good movie plot?

•	Can we make a successful movie with a low budget? Or is budget a relevant factor of success?

•	Do viewers enjoy seeing character stereotypes in a movie? Does their presence have an influence on a movie’s success?


# Additional Datasets

In addition to our main CMU movies dataset, we decided to use others in order to be able to properly answer our questions:

•	[**Freebase ID to IMDB ID**](https://query.wikidata.org/#PREFIX%20wd%3A%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikidata.org%2Fentity%2F%3E%0APREFIX%20wdt%3A%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.wikidata.org%2Fprop%2Fdirect%2F%3E%0APREFIX%20wikibase%3A%20%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwikiba.se%2Fontology%23%3E%0A%0ASELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FfreebaseID%20%3FimdbID%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279%2a%20wd%3AQ11424.%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP646%20%3FfreebaseID.%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP345%20%3FimdbID.%0A%20%20%7D) : a dataset of a mapping from Freebase ID to IMDb ID. We merge the query.tsv dataset with the movie_metadata one on Freebase ID. We need this dataset to be able to  to merge the IMDb ratings dataset and the budget dataset (both identified by IMDb ID) with our Freebase ID identified movies from the CMU dataset.

•	[**IMDb Ratings**](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) : a dataset from IMDb for the movies’ ratings . We merge the ratings.tsv dataset with our dataset from CMU on IMDb ID.

•	[**Budgets**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?resource=download&select=movies_metadata.csv) : a dataset from Kaggle for the budgets . We merge the dataset from Kaggle (only keeping budget and IMDb ID columns) with our dataset from CMU on IMDb ID.

# Methods

### Step 1. Preprocessing and dataset construction

**Preprocessing**: We load and clean the CMU datasets, checking for NaN values and removing or cleaning columns (For example, we removed the ‘revenue’ column of movie_metadata as 87% of it was NaN values)

**Datasets construction**: We create our dataset for our future analysis by combining thr CMU ones with the additional ones:
-	movie_rating : creating our base final dataset by merging movie_metadata with a cleaned version of IMDB ratings
-	movie_ratings_budgets : the dataset to be used to run the analysis on budgets, created by merging movie_rating with a cleaned version of Kaggle movie_metadata.csv
-	name_cluster_analysis : the dataset to be used to run analysis on character names, created by merging movie_rating, character_metadata and name_clusters.
-	Tropes: the dataset to be used to run analysis on character tropes, created by merging a cleaned version of tropes.csv with name_cluster_analysis.

### Step 2. Language 

To assess the influence of English on movies, we split films into two categories: those not in English language and those in English along with at least one other language. We made initial visualizations to examine these categories. To determine if there was a statistically significant difference in scores between the two groups, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. For a deeper analysis, we also performed subgroup analyses within different movie genres.
	
### Step 3. Character name

### Step 4. Genre and release date

### Step 5. Movie plots

### Step 6. Budgets

### Step 7. Character type

#### 3. Data visualization
After having cleaned the data, initial plotting of the features which each potentially alter the movie ratings: checking to see if the research questions are feasible, checking for trends, deciding what further analysis is necessary to conduct for our research questions.

#### 4. Linear Regression
Check for the correlation between the features chosen in in the research questions and see how the movie ratings are consequentially affected.

#### 5. Natural Process Learning (NLP)
We use NLP techniques to analyze the movie plots to determine what makes a good plot in terms of predicting a good average rating. We start by preproccessing the plots by removing special characters, removing stop words and lemmatizing/stemming words. We then created a bag-of-words matrix and trained a linear-regression model with average movie rating as target. We then looked at the cooeficient for each word to determine the importance of each words in regards to the average movie rating. Next steps are to use more data, more complex models like introducing regression or training neural nets. We will also explore word embeddings as an alternative to bag-of-words and then finally properly test the models and see if it is possible to determine if a plot can predict a movie rating.
